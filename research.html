  <p>I am currently working on several different problems related to the dynamics and remote sensing of the ionosphere and thermosphere system. We are particularly interested in the multiscale structure of these fields and how to properly model them. </p>
    
   <p>One of our main tools in this task are <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/383/2/539/993257">needlets.</a> The needlets \(\psi_{jk}\) form a Parseval-tight frame of the Hilbert Space \(\mathcal{L}^2\left(\mathbb{S}^n\right)\). This means that, if \( f\in \mathcal{L}^2\left(\mathbb{S}^n\right) \), there are coefficients \(\beta_{jk}\) such that</p> 

$$
f(x) = \sum_{j,k}\beta_{jk}\psi_{jk}(x)
$$
$$
\beta_{jk} = \int_{\mathbb{S}^n} f(y) \psi_{jk}(y) \text{d}\nu(y)
$$
$$
\sum |\beta_{jk}|^2 = ||f||_2^{2} 
$$

This gives Parseval-tight frames the reconstruction properties of orthonormal bases that we know and love, with additional flexibility. Once I figure out how to add a bibliography on here I will do it properly, but for now the book "An Introduction to Frames and Riesz Bases" by Ole Christiansen provides a good overview of frames generally, and the book "Random Fields on the Sphere" by Marinucci and Peccati provides details on needlets specifically. Our most recent research adds these to a latent Gaussian Process framework, which, along with a Lasso penalty on the precision matrix of the coefficients and a compactly supported covariance model for the residuals, allows us to develop a faithful statistical model of neutral temperature in the lower thermosphere (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01318">The paper is currently on ArXiV.</a>). This model was inspired by the work of Krock et al on the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2174126">Basis Graphical Lasso</a>
 and the full-scale approximations investigated by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1226319208000045">Michael Stein</a>(although he did not call them full-scale approximations) and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01007.x">Sang and Huang</a>, hence the name. The paper is currently under review.

<p> In addition to the problem of spatial modeling of these fields, we are also interested in methods for determining the neutral temperature of the thermosphere. Anything in low-Earth orbit moves through the thermosphere, and uncertainty in the drag these objects experience is the primary driver of uncertainty in their positions. While several methods for determining the neutral temperature from FUV observations exist, we are particularly interested in those that are based on ratios of the intensity of different channels, which are explored, for example, in <a href="https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/6917/2021/">this paper</a> by Clayton Cantrall and Tomoko Matsuo and <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JA026379">this paper</a> by Yongliang Zhang et al. 
  Currently, we are exploring the application of permanental processes to this problem to allow for extension into a spatial model.
  In permanental processes, the key innovation of the model is that the intensity function is a squared Gaussian process. Because of this it is possible to use reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques to fit the intensity from the photon counts. 
   This additionally allows for both guarantees of smoothness through relationships between RKHSs and Sobolev Spaces through the Mercer expansion and the spectrum of the fractional Laplacian, and for accurate quantification of uncertainty in the intensity ratio. This is done by allowing us to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the intensity ratio at a given location as a generalized Beta-prime distribution with a good deal of accuracy. 
  Initial results are promising but there is still work to do here. 
  For some background, see <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/flaxman17a.html">this paper</a> by Flaxman et al and <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/walder17a.html">this paper</a> by Walder and Bishop.

 <p>More is coming, but I have been working on an <a href="https://github.com/mfleduc/PoissonRatioUQ">R package</a> for use in this and similar problems. It is not yet on CRAN, but it will be shortly. It also does not yet support the permanental process model, but it does support a pointwise version of the model that is similar to the one that appears in <a href="https://hea-www.harvard.edu/astrostat/behr/park_etal_apj.pdf"> this paper (PDF)</a> by Park et al used in a classification problem in x-ray astronomy. This paper directly inspired the work that I am doing, and the permanental process model is an attempt to generalize this into a spatial model.</p>
