<p>Hello and welcome to my personal site! I am a current PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado. My current research focuses on spatial statistics and inverse problems, working primarily under the guidance of Dr. Tomoko Matsuo in the Geospatial Data Science Lab. I have previously worked in fluids, oceanography, and acoustics.</p>
